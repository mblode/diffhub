# DiffHub

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/diffhub)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diffhub)
[![Node.js 20.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-20.11+-green)](https://nodejs.org)

GitHub PR-style diff viewer. Opens in the browser and shows tracked changes relative to your merge-base by default, with a UI toggle for uncommitted-only changes, split/unified diff views, inline comments, and live auto-refresh.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g diffhub
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx diffhub
```

## Usage

Run inside any git repository:

```bash
diffhub
```

Opens `http://localhost:2047` and shows tracked changes relative to your branch merge-base (`main`, `master`, `develop`, or `dev`, auto-detected).

```bash
# Use a different base branch
diffhub --base develop

# Point at a repo in another directory
diffhub --repo ~/projects/my-app

# Use a different port
diffhub --port 3000

# Don't open the browser automatically
diffhub --no-open
```

## Features

- **PR-style diff** — defaults to merge-base diffs and also supports an uncommitted-only mode from the UI
- **Split and unified views** — toggle with `s`, keyboard-navigable with `j` / `k`
- **Whitespace filtering** — ignore whitespace-only changes from the top bar when reviewing formatting-heavy diffs
- **Inline AI comments** — add `[must-fix]`, `[suggestion]`, `[nit]`, or `[question]` notes on any diff line; copy all comments as a formatted prompt
- **"Open in" context menu** — right-click any file to open in Zed, VS Code, Ghostty, Terminal, Finder, or copy the path
- **Live refresh** — watches local file changes and updates the diff automatically; force refresh with `r`
- **File sidebar** — filter files with `/`, see per-file `+`/`-` stats at a glance

## Development notes

- The standalone CLI injects `DIFFHUB_REPO` into the Next.js server process.
- Local development can also point at a repo through `DIFFHUB_REPO` or the `/tmp/diffhub-active-repo` pointer file used by `diffhub-point`.
- The app ships a standalone Next.js build via `bin/diffhub.mjs`, not `next start`.
- Browser coverage for the comments UI lives in `e2e/` and runs with `npm -w apps/cli run test:visual` from the monorepo root. The Playwright harness creates a deterministic fixture git repo and writes screenshots, traces, and reports under `apps/cli/test-results/`.
